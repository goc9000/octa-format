OCTA Format
===========

OCTA (Online Crawling Trace Archive) is a database format for storing the complete history ("trace") of Web crawling
sessions.

The format is designed to enable online, concurrent operation for multiple parties while the crawler is still running.
It also aims to be open, portable, tolerant of incomplete data, extensible, while also providing support for large
binary content, compression, deduplication and arbitrary annotations.

Details can be found in the `Octa Format` document.
